              <h3>Bio</h3>
              <p>I am Gavin Tafoya, a student at Boise State University. I am currently studying "Games, Interactive Media and Mobile Technologies" and earning a minor in Computer Science.

                Being an aspiring game developer, I have always been interested in the design and development of games. Over the past 3 years, I have developed a wide array of software applications, which can be found on the <a href="artifact.php">artifacts</a> page.
