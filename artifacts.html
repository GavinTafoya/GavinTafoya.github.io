                                MonopolAR is a game that I developed with a team of 4 for my GIMM 110 class at Boise
                                State University. MonopolAR is essentially a game of Monopoly, but with a twist. The
                                game is played through your phone camera, using the Unity AR Foundations package. With
                                this, you can use your own monopoly board and play a virtual version with no setup
                                required. The image target creates an anchor point that the virtual play area will be
                                set on top of and then the game is played similar to normal monopoly. Getting a demo of
                                the AR functionality is nearly impossible for me as of right now because it must be run
                                on an Android device, but I have created a desktop version as well, which can be viewed
                                on github.

                                Burglar Trap is a 2D game I made for my first GIMM project. In the game, you control the
                                security system of a store, as burglars try to break in. Being set up as a tower
                                defense, the player will control guns, grenades, and time in order to stop the hordes of
                                enemies who follow the set path. Having some experience with Unity and C# from previous
                                projects, I was challenged to take the development a step further. To do this, I
                                implemented the library for a LeapMotion hand tracker, which will track the movements of
                                your hands and create a skeletal map over what is tracked. This gives the player the
                                ability to control aspects of the game with their gestures. The two guns will follow the
                                position of the player's hand and split if two hands are detected. If the player closes
                                their fist to a certain point a grenade will detonate at the point being aimed at and if
                                the player flips their hand upside down, the time will be frozen gradually. Finally, if
                                the player makes an "ok" sign with their hand, time will begin to reverse.

                                Buccaneers from Beyond is a fixed action 2D shooter, similar to Galaga. The player
                                controls a pirate ship, the Friggerock, and must destroy the enemy ships, which are
                                manned by Vikings. The idea may not seem very unique at first, but the gameplay gets
                                very interesting. For starters you are fighting in space, aboard a space "pirate ship"
                                that must be upgraded through the resources collected by destroying the enemy ships. The
                                four upgradable parts of the ship are the fuel capacity, ship integrity, cannon power
                                and thruster force. Once the player has survived long enough, they will encounter one of
                                the great Nordic beasts. Some of which include the Kraken and Fenrir. The player must
                                destroy these beasts in order to progress to the next level. The game has no real end as
                                the player can continue upgrading their ship and becoming more and more powerful. This
                                game was made to compete in the SkillsUSA "Interactive Application and Video Game
                                Design" competition, and I had a main partner, and some minor outside help. My official
                                role on the team was the main artist, however, I also did the majority of the
                                programming. Some of the concept art was made by someone who was not a part of the team.
                                My partner and I won gold at the state level and competed at the national level. The
                                game can be downloaded and viewed on GameJolt.

                            <p class="card-text">
                                The smart chair project was one of the tasks assigned to my co-intern and I from our
                                internship with the GimmWorks Development Team. The task was to create a chair that
                                could detect when a person was sitting down. The chair was built using 2 highly
                                sensitive pressure sensors and an arduino with WiFi capabilities. The arduino must be
                                attached to the chair in some way; for our design I 3D modeled a box which the arduino
                                would sit in. The design shown in the video was our final prototype which was used as
                                inspiration for a GIMM IoT class (GIMM 340 I believe). Once a person sits on the chair,
                                the arduino will record the timestamp at time of activation and when there is no more
                                input (meaning they stand up) the arduino will record that time and calculate the time
                                difference. The arduino will then send this data to a website hosted on Heroku, which
                                will then display that information using the JavaScript charts and graphs library. The
                                website was designed using PHP, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Unfortunately, the website was
                                shut down after the internship.

                                Parallel is an interactive comic experience I created on a team of 4 in my second
                                Semester of the GIMM program. The game explains the concept of quantum entanglement
                                through the use of mirror controls and both visual and gameplay elements. The player
                                controls characters, A and B, who are tasked with escaping a ship overrun by alien
                                ghosts, while solving puzzles to escape each panel’s room. The repository for this
                                project can be viewed on github.
