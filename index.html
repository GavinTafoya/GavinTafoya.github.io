    <p>
        Hi, my name is Gavin Tafoya. I am currently a second-year honors student at Boise State University; majoring in Games, Interactive Media and Mobile Technologies (GIMM) and minoring in Computer Science.
        I have a passion for video games and the technology that goes into creating them. I am also interested in learning about the different aspects of computer science and how they can be applied to the gaming industry.
        On this website, you will find information <a href="#">about me</a>, my <a href="#">resume</a>, and the <a href="#">projects</a> I have worked on.
