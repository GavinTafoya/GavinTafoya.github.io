            Hi, my name is Gavin Tafoya. I am currently a second-year honors student at Boise State University; majoring in Games, Interactive Media and Mobile Technologies (GIMM) and minoring in Computer Science.
            I have a passion for video games and the technology that goes into creating them. I am also interested in the different aspects of computer science and how they can be applied to the gaming industry.
            On this website, you will find information <a href="#">about me</a>, my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>, and the <a href="artifacts.html">projects</a> I have worked on. You can contact me at
